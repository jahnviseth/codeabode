FACE_RECOGNITION.PY program recognizes faces(from the faces folder) and takes a person's attendance with the time on the date.
Judges can take face pics from the test images folder and show them to the webcam through their mobile(screen reflection may cause some problems)
Judges can even put their own face in the faces folder and get their face recognized(through webcam) and attendance taken.
